# Depth Camera
An iOS app for measuring the depth/distance of objects from the camera plane using the TrueDepth sensor on an iPhone. This data will be used to measure the distance between a person's hand and the phone camera, to be used for measuring Parkinson's tremor amplitude using computer vision.

All of the code within this repository is a part of my dissertation "Development of a Computer Vision Method to Measure Parkinson's Tremor Amplitude", supervised by Dr. David Wong of the University of Manchester.
